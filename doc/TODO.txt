+ Controller system
    + OK implement construction of chains
    + implement dispatching
    + EDSL for filtering and dispatching
        {{{ 
           get( _ == "/index" ) {  (rq) => {
                fetchSomething(rq)
             }
           }
           post( _ match {
                    case Request(XXX) => true
                    case _ false
            }) {  (rq) => alterSomething(rq)  }
        }}}

    + Add ability to map types 
        Something like:
        {{{
            map( "/path/or/something/", classOf[Person] )
        }}}

        should match https methods with member functions of the type
        should use structural typing
        how to autoredir to views/representations? 
                --> after processing look for package/type/view/verb ?
